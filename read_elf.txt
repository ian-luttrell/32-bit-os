	; get entry point from ELF header
	MOV EAX, DWORD [0x8218]
	; shift off the highest nibble of the entry point. The lower 12 bits tell us the offset of
	;     the .text section in the 4th sector of the floppy 
	SHL EAX, 20
	SHR EAX, 20
	; store result in EBX	
	MOV EBX, EAX

	; divide EAX by 0x200 to the number of sectors (past 0x8200) where entry point resides
	;     (will probably be 2 sectors past, i.e. the 6th sector of floppy)
	; then add 0x8000 to EBX to determine the memory location where we need to load the image
	;     (i.e. the entry point of image, as specified by linker script link.ld)
